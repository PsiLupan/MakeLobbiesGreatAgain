# WHAT IS MLGA?

MLGA stands for "Make Lobbies Great Again". In any Peer to peer lobby, MLGA can be run to view the people you are connected to, see their ping, and toggle a blocked/loved setting for each of them.

*This is a continuation of the original project, adapted to work for any - and every - peer-hosted game.
It supports loading any lists of users you've previously created, but no longer automatically backs up or interacts with any game data.*

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
MakeLobbiesGreatAgain uses a packet capture library to detect STUN packets from any peer-to-peer connection, in order to determine who you're connected to and get ping from.
It is not detected as a hack, since it does not and will not interact with the game ever.
